# lilfrog (alpha)
A Python suite for maintaining content-driven websites. 

This can be used to:
- run automated accessibility scans using [axe-core-python](https://pypi.org/project/axe-core-python/) 
- evaluate the readability of webpages using [textstat](https://pypi.org/project/axe-core-python/)
- check for broken links.

lilfrog is in active development. Upcoming changes include the ability to output results in formats besides CSV files (JSON, HTML, and PDF), as well as a basic web UI. 

This software is considered alpha quality and may contain bugs. It should not be used in a production environment.
